# Shopify Sections - Klaviyo Add On

Shopify Section with Klaviyo Custom API Built In

## Description

A section you can add to any Shopify2.0 theme that has a pre-built Klaviyo form that submits information through the track API.
The great thing about this section is it can be added after the fact to any page type the store owner wants. They just have to add the section via the Shopify Customizer like seen below:

This specific section is hard coded with some content, but that content can be changed as needed to fit the scope of any given project/idea.


## Getting Started

### Installing

* Add the custom-klaviyo-section.liquid section to your Shopify theme
